                    <div class="grid_8 column">
    				    <p>This privacy policy tells you about the way Debtonator (we, our or us), collects information, holds it, uses it, and if we disclose it, who we disclose it to.</p>
                    </div>

    				<h3 class="grid_3 column">You own your data</h3>
                    <div class="grid_8 column">
    				    <p>Debtonator is a Debtor reminder service which stores information about a company or individual (Organisation) as provided or entered by that company or individual. Debtonator will only store information that is entered by the Users of an Organisation, or automatically imported at a User’s instruction. The data entered, or imported on instruction, by the Users of an Organisation remains the property of the Organisation and Debtonator will not use nor make available for use any of this information without permission of the Organisation.</p>
                    </div>
    			</li>
    			<li class="row container">
    				<h3 class="grid_3 column">You control who has access to your data</h3>
                    <div class="grid_8 column">
        				<p>The data entered, or imported on instruction, by the Users of an Organisation is stored securely in a database and is only accessible to the approved Users of the Organisation. A user name and password is required in order to access an Organisation's information in Debtonator.</p>
        				<p>It is the responsibility of users to keep their passwords safe. It is the responsibility of the initial registrar of the Organisation on Debtonator to ensure that any Users that are invited to use the Organisation’s account have permission to view the Organisation’s information stored in the Debtonator account.</p>

                    <div class="grid_8 column">
        				<p>Debtonator has access to and may use aggregate information such as number of associated Users, number of transactions and billing information for the purpose of billing and monitoring server and software performance as well as for other internal purposes of Debtonator.</p>
        				<p>Debtonator staff and key commercial partners can access non-identifying and aggregated usage information and transaction volumes in order to better understand how our customers are using Debtonator  so we can improve the system design and where appropriate have the system prompt users with suggestions on ways to improve their own use of the system. All aggregated usage information is stored in a secure Debtonator  data warehouse facility.</p>

    				<h3 class="grid_3 column">Your data is sent securely across the internet</h3>
                    <div class="grid_8 column">
        				<p>Debtonator Servers have commercial security certificates so all data transferred between the Users of an organisation and the Debtonator  Servers is encrypted. However, the internet is not in itself a secure environment. Users should only enter, or instruct the importation of, data to the database within a secure environment. This means that the User’s browser must support the encryption security used in connection with the Debtonator Servers.</p>
        				<p>Debtonator stores your Data in the location Debtonator considers will give the Organisation and its Users most efficient access from wherever in the World they may be. Access and storage controls via the Software and the Website are however administered by Debtonator in England as the holder of that Data. Debtonator's address and contact details are available on our contact page. Where an Organisation or User accesses or inputs Data from somewhere other than the country where the Data is stored or to be stored, the Organisation and the User consent to that Data being transferred from one country to the other (including via any intermediate country) as a function of transmission across the internet.</p>

        				<p>Your browser stores only enough information to keep you logged in.</p>
